## How to run

It's very easy for you to run the code on this repository, I've already written a [shell script (main.sh)](https://github.com/LebrancWorkshop/Learn-Go-from-Youtube/blob/main/main.sh) for you to run  

And it will contain the result of both C++ Code and generate Assembly Code from C++ Code. (In case of my default Assembly code in the repository, it's an [Go's Assembler (Unix-based ARM64)](https://github.com/LebrancWorkshop/Learn-Go-from-Youtube/search?l=Motorola+68K+Assembly) and if you want to understand the assembly code you can get the detail from [this link](https://go.dev/doc/asm).)

You can just run by use this script below.

```bash
sh main.sh <folder_name_that_you_want_to_run>
```
